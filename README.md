### NOV2022

#### I joined the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" Competition sponsored by Kaggle:

#### The purpose of the competition is to predict the price of a house using the given data with approximately 80 features. Competitors upload their predictions and are scored according to accuracy.

#### To choose my model, I used a flowchart from the scikit learn website:

#### Using the flowchart, I chose Ridge Regression as the model. This gave me an accuracy of approximately 61.5%. With this model, I am currently in 4199th place in the competition. This competition allows unlimited submissions in an unlimited period of time, so I plan to continue to refine my model and resubmit.
